# ctf-scripts
A collection of scripts I've written to solve recurring challenges in CTFs.

## Scripts

- `change_jpeg_dimensions.py`:
    This script changes the dimensions on a JPEG image by editing the Start of Frame segment directly, leaving the image data untouched.

- `keystrokes_from_pcap.py`:
    This script attempts to parse the keystrokes out of a USB pcap file.

- `png_fix.py`:
    This script implements a number of techniques for fixing broken / corrupted PNG files.

- `wav_parse.py`:
    Really not too sure ngl to you, it does parse WAV files though.
